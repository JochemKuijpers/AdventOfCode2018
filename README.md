# AdventOfCode2018
I took part in [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), which is an advent calendar of small programming challenges. Primarily because it's fun, and secondary to give myself an excuse to get more familiar with C++ :)

This repository holds my solutions to the puzzles.
